&lt;p>I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard from Will or spoken to him in some time but the out of the blue call from James did leave me winded. James and I spoke for quite a while, reminiscing about things and I think both of us could not quite believe it. Our friendship came about through our love of Apple Mac computers and a strange coincidence of geography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My interest in Macs started when I bought an 17&amp;quot; G5 iMac in 2005. At the time my work life was entirely Windows centric and I think I recall deciding to buy a Mac mostly out of curiosity. I was of course quickly sold by the elegance, slick design and polished software.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I think soon after I bought into the Mac lifestyle I registered this domain (ukmac.net) and started with my early blog focused on Apple and my new Mac. As a keen Apple fan I of course started consuming what I could from the Internet from various web sites/blogs and also from a number of podcasts such as Macbreak Weekly and the wildly eccentric BritishMac podcast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BritishMac was a regular chart topper in the podcast Tech charts in those days and by a bizarre twist of fate was run by Will who happened to live only a few miles from me in Ironbridge, Shropshire. Through another weird coincidence I came into contact with James who had also recently started a Mac focused blog at Ukmac.co.uk, even more coincidently James lived in Broseley a few miles away from Ironbridge in the opposite direction from myself. It was meant to be I guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suffice to say James, Will and myself ended up meeting in Ironbridge for a few beers and to talk about our favourite subject, Macs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Will was one of life&amp;rsquo;s characters. If you ever heard any of his podcast episodes you will know what I mean. His blog and podcast were unique and eccentric, there really weren&amp;rsquo;t any like it at the time (nor since that I have seen at least). In addition to his irregular podcast postings Will used to host a Christmas get together in Ironbridge and would invite any of his listeners who wished to meet up for drinks and a curry at his local Indian restaurant, the Aftab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a couple of these meet-ups Will got us together at a little studio he had at the time to record a podcast episode before we headed to town for food. The resulting recordings were somewhat less than polished but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the point and didn&amp;rsquo;t stop everyone enjoying being part of the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Will&amp;rsquo;s funeral was this Tuesday in Shrewsbury and I was fully intending to go to show my respects and also to meet-up with some of the group that used to go to Will&amp;rsquo;s Christmas events but in a cruel twist I have been laid up in bed all week with a viral illness and was not able to make it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sweet and Wide...</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/sweet-and-wide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/sweet-and-wide/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://ukmac.net/p/sweet-and-wide/wide.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Sweet and Wide..." />&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/48126477@N05/16616199274" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
